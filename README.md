# Incident_handler
Incident handling is a vital aspect of cybersecurity focused on the effective management of security incidents, which can include data breaches, malware infections, unauthorized access, or other forms of cyberattacks. The process encompasses several key stages: preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis. Preparation involves establishing policies, procedures, and tools to handle incidents effectively. Detection and analysis help identify an incident and assess its scope and impact. Containment ensures that the incident does not spread further, while eradication removes the root cause, such as malware or compromised accounts. Recovery focuses on restoring affected systems to normal operation, ensuring no residual threats remain. Finally, post-incident analysis reviews the response process to identify lessons learned and improve future defenses. Incident handlers work closely with other security teams, such as SOC analysts and forensic experts, to protect an organizationâ€™s assets, maintain operational continuity, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
